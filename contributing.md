# Contributing guidelines

This guides are not permanent. They should evolve as our team grows and learns. If you don't like something, of if you think we can improve, please open a pull request. We love pull requests.

## Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at SVI to see them. We're spread accross different timezones, so we leave all PRs open for at least a week give everyone a chance to give feedback.
