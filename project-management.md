# SVI's Project Management Workflow

This is how we interface with clients, run sprints, and use GitHub to track the progress
of our projects.

This guide is just a start, and it's meant to change as we grow and learn. **If you disagree with anything, open an issue.** In the meantime, stick to the guide. Please see the [contributing guidelines](/contributing.md) for more info.

## Sprint Timeline

### Day 0: First day of sprint
- All members of the engineering team get together with the PM
- We look at the list of issues, and assign 2 weeks worth of work
- The PM should add all of the issues that need to be addressed during the sprint to a sprint milestone.
- We send an email update to the client with finalized sprint details

### Day 7: Mid-sprint checkin
 - All members of the engineering team get together with the PM
 - Everybody answers:
  - What are you blocked on?
  - Are you on track to finish everything?
- The sprint should be recalibrate depending on how things are going. If we're ahead, we can add some issues. If we ran into things, we might need to get rid of some issues.
- We send an email update to the client with what we accomplished, what issues we ran into, and what we hope to accomplish by the end of the sprint.

### Day 13: Last day of sprint
- We do a quick final checkup. We only need to meet together if things don't look good. If things look good, we can simply discuss the sprint status in Slack.
- Meet with the client to:
 - Discuss with the client how the sprint went
 - Prioritize, update and clarify user stories for the next sprint

## Creating issues

We use issues to track of bugs, features and everything else. We use labels to keep them organized.

### Add a type label

Add a label for the type of the issue.

#### `type: bug`
- Answer the following questions in the issue description:
 - What is the expected behavior?
 - What is the actual behavior?
 - What are the steps to reproduce the bug?
- For UI bugs, make sure to include a screenshot
- Include a stack trace if one is available

#### `type: feature`
- Features should be described as a user story.
- Break large features into several smaller ones, and keep them as self-contained as possible. Each feature should have the granularity of 1 day maxâ€” if it doesn't break it down further.
- The description should include all of the information needed to implement the feature.

#### `type: other`
- Use the other label for UI improvements, performance improvements, refactoring, security improvements, or anything else.
- We can always add new types if `type: other` becomes overused.

#### Add a priority label
- `priority: HIGH`: Critical, needs to be addressed immediately.
- `priority: med`: Important, needs to be handled in this sprint or the next.
- `priority: low`: Can wait until we have spare time.

#### Assign the issue to someone

- Each issue needs to be assigned on creation.
- If you're not sure who to assign the issue to, then assign it to the PM.


## Tracking sprint issues with milestones
* Create a new milestone for each sprint
* All of the issues that are going to be tackled during the sprint should be in the milestone, and nothing more
* The title of the milestone should follow this syntax: `Sprint 4: April 6th - 18th`
* The milestone deadline should be the last day of the sprint
