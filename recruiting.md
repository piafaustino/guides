# SVI's Recruiting Guide

## Sourcing

Sourcing is the act of finding promising candidates. There are tons of ways to source good candidates, and we should constantly try new methods and ideas. 

We source candidates in batches for a couple reasons. 
* It's easier to automate that way. We repeat the same steps for a large number of candidates. 
* We can track and measure the performance of each batch. 
* Following up is easier, since we can do it batch by batch. 

### Creating a candidate batch

Head over to the [Sourced Candidates](https://docs.google.com/a/benigeri.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Chzj03l_-ZopV9jEdY7d0YCB947lpDGpL7UNzdu9Pw/edit#gid=502101021) spreadsheet and create a new sheet for the batch. Name the sheet something reasonable, like `Android Ukraine LinkedIn`

#### What columns do I need? 

* Profile URL
* First Name
* Last Name 
* Email
* Contacted
* In Pipeline

The `In Pipeline` column is empty by default, and set to `TRUE` once a Trello card has been created. 

The `Merged` column is empty by default, and set to `TRUE` once the candidate has received a mail merged email from us. 

The `Profile URL` will depend on how the candidate was sourced. It could be a LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow profile, a personal website, etc... 

## Pipeline

We use Trello to manage our [Recruiting Pipeline](https://trello.com/b/ZNrbiz9x/svi-recruiting). Each list a different stage in the recruiting process. 

### Sourced List

Candidates that have been sourced outside of a batch. For example, it could have referral, or we could have spotted someone on GitHub

### New Recruits List

Each candidate that engages in a recruiting conversation with us should be added to this list. The best way to [create a new card by emailing Trello](http://help.trello.com/article/809-creating-cards-by-email).

To move to the next stage, each card should be cleaned up: 
* Keep key points from the email thread, but delete the rest
* Add the candidate's profile (usually obtained during sourcing) as an attachment
* Add the `Needs Response` label
* Add a label for the candidate's position if it's clear
* In the `Sourced Candidates` spreadsheet, note that the candidate has been added to the Trello pipeline

### Inbox

We are in dialog with candidates in this list. The goal now is to schedule an Interest call.
